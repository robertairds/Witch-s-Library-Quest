# CS50x – Scratch Project

This is my first project for Harvard’s CS50 course (Problem Set 0).

## 🎮 Project Description
A small exploration game set inside a magical library. The player clicks on books and objects to find a lost grimoire. Each item reacts in some way: some books speak and give hints, others simply perform their normal functions, and a few may respond in a rude or humorous way. Animals and magical creatures are also part of the experience.

## 🕹️ How to Play
- Use the mouse to click on books and objects
- Explore the library
- Find the lost grimoire
