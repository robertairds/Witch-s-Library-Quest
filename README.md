# Witch-s-Library-Quest
# CS50x – Scratch Project

This is my first project for Harvard’s CS50 course (Problem Set 0).

## 🎮 Project Description
A small exploration game set inside a magical library. The player clicks on books and objects to find a lost grimoire. Some items speak and give hints, others simply perform their normal functions, and a few respond in a rude or humorous way. Animals and magical creatures are also part of the game.
